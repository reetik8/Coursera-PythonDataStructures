# Coursera-PythonDataStructures

Quizzes and Coding Assignment

This course introduces the core data structures of the Python programming language. It moved past the basics of procedural programming and helped to explore how we can use the Python built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples to perform increasingly complex data analysis. This course covered Chapters 6-10 of the textbook “Python for Everybody”.  This course covers Python 3.
